# This program acts as an online ordering program. The supplier data is provided will be taken into
# The program and shown to the user. The user is then prompted to pick an item and quantity which it
# Then adds to a total cost. Errors are prited if the user asks for too much or the part doesn't exist


# Here is where the supplier data is imported, this program is designed such that any specifications 
# can be imported and the program will still work. The json file is converted to a Dictionary so that
# The values in the file can be extracted and indexed.
